    "# Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook just provides a small introduction to python which you will be requiring for this bootcamp. This is not a compulsory notebook and if you are already experienced with python you can jump right into the notebook for day 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this notebook is to familarize you with python syntax and also introduce the package numpy. If you are running this on colab you will not need any additional installations and this will also run if you are using Jupyter Anoconda. We do suggest using the IBM Q experience for future notebooks as you will require qiskit and its smoother to run it on IBM Q rather than all the installation. \n",
    "To setup an IBM Q account refer https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login. \n",
    "For installing qiskit refer this https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html\n",
    "If you have any doubts, feel free to drop them on the telegram group.\n",
